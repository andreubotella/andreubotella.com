Hi. I'm Andreu Botella (pronouns he/they), a web browser and standards engineer
working at [Igalia](https://igalia.com). I'm currently working on various things
in the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser engine (which powers
browsers such as Google Chrome), largely involving website layout. I also work
on the [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org) project, helping bring features highly
wanted by server-side JavaScript runtimes into the web standards, and
implementing them in browsers.

Some of the areas of the web platform and browsers that I have worked on are
character encodings, form submission, the `multipart/form-data` form submission
encoding, web workers, structured cloning, text editing and layout, JavaScript
realms and [`ShadowRealm`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm), among
others. I have contributed to several of the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org) and
[W3C](https://w3.org) web specifications, and worked on all three mainstream
browser engines, as well as made extensive contributions to the
[Deno](https://deno.land) JavaScript runtime.

Before I started working on web browsers and standards, I used to be a
full-stack web developer, with experience working with languages, runtimes and
frameworks such as Node.js, React, Next.js, Express.js and PHP.

Other interests of mine include math, physics, linguistics, music...
