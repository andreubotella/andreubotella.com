# Andreu<wbr>Botella<wbr>.com

Hi. I'm Andreu Botella (pronouns they/them), a web browser and standards
engineer working at [Igalia](https://igalia.com). I'm currently working on
various things in the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser engine
(which powers browsers such as Google Chrome), largely involving website layout.
I'm also a co-chair of [WinterTC](https://wintertc.org), which aims to make
server-side and edge JavaScript runtimes (such as Node.js, Deno, Cloudflare
Workers...) more interoperable among themselves as well as with the web.

Some of the areas of the web platform that I'm currently working on are
[improving `-webkit-line-clamp`](https://github.com/Igalia/explainers/blob/main/css/line-clamp/README.md)
and making it easier to propagate state across `await`s in JavaScript with the
[`AsyncContext`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) TC39 proposal.

I've also worked in the past on character encodings, form submission, the
`multipart/form-data` form submission encoding, web workers, structured cloning
and text editing. I have contributed to several of the
[WHATWG](https://whatwg.org) and [W3C](https://w3.org) web specifications, and
worked on all three mainstream browser engines, as well as made extensive
contributions to the [Deno](https://deno.land) JavaScript runtime.

Before I started working on web browsers and standards, I used to be a
full-stack web developer, with experience working with languages, runtimes and
frameworks such as Node.js, React, Next.js, Express.js and PHP.

Other interests of mine include math, physics, linguistics, music...
