    A number of talks I've given at various events about my work on web browsers
    and standards.

talks:
  - name: Past and future of server-side runtimes
    coSpeakers:
      - name: Nicol√≤ Ribaudo
        url: https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo
    event:
      name: NodeConf EU 2023
      url: https://www.nodeconf.eu
    date: 2023-11-08
    length: ~25 minutes
    target: Server-side JS developers
    slides: https://abotella.pages.igalia.com/past-and-future-of-server-side-runtimes
    youtubeId: LdnmN2qGo0g

      The history of server-side JavaScript runtimes has seen evolutions and
      revolutions in a number of aspects: ways of doing I/O, module systems,
      interoperability across different runtimes, interoperability with the web,
      and much more.

      This talk explores this history, covering past innovations and
      standardization efforts (did you know that
      [CommonJS](https://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) was much more than a
      module system?). We then learn about [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/), a
      new effort to coordinate runtimes to interoperate with the web, and
      discuss how it can shape the future of server-side JavaScript.

  - name: Integrating Task Attribution and `AsyncContext`
    event:
      name: BlinkOn 18
      url: https://www.chromium.org/events/blinkon-18/
    date: 2023-10-19
    length: ~25 minutes
    target: Chromium developers, browser developers, web standards engineers
    slides: https://abotella.pages.igalia.com/async-context-integration
    youtubeId: vGCOwR73hC8
    description: |
      [`AsyncContext`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) is a TC39
      proposal that tracks user-provided values across asynchronous
      continuations (`await` points), as well as web APIs such as event
      handlers. The work that's currently being done in
      [task attribution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_m-h9_KgDMddTS2OFP0CShr4zjU-C-up64DwCrCfBo4/edit?usp=sharing)
      also tracks browser-internal values across asynchronous continuations and
      web APIs. It would be better to layer one of these two features on top of
      the other, in Chromium and in the specifications.

      This session aims to discuss this integration, whether the semantics of
      these two features agree in regards to web APIs, and how they should be
      layered.

  - name: Updates on `line-clamp`
    event:
      name: BlinkOn 18
      url: https://www.chromium.org/events/blinkon-18/
    date: 2023-10-17
    length: Lightning talk (~3 minutes)
    target: Chromium developers, browser developers, web standards engineers
    slides: https://abotella.pages.igalia.com/line-clamp-2023
    youtubeId: VZNm7ik4hdE
    description: |
      This lightning talk discusses the updates on `line-clamp` that happened
      since the previous edition of BlinkOn, in particular about how the CSS
      Working Group is working on two separate proposals, and on how I made
      working implementations in Chromium for both of them.

  - name: Specifying `line-clamp`
    event:
      name: BlinkOn 17
      url: https://www.chromium.org/events/blinkon-17/
    date: 2022-11-15
    length: Lightning talk (~3 minutes)
    target: Chromium developers, browser developers, web standards engineers
    slides: https://abotella.pages.igalia.com/blink-on-17-line-clamp
    youtubeId: DWZ3BcDSpo0
    description: |
      This lightning talk covers the `-webkit-line-clamp` CSS property, which
      clamps an element's text to a number of lines with an ellipsis at the end.
      It talks about its many shortcomings, and about various proposals under
      discussion by the CSS Working Group on how to fix them.
